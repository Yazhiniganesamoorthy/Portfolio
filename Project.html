                <h2>Automatic Irrigation With IoT Monitorizing Soil Moisture</h2>
                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Python.</p>
                    <p>• Developed a Machine learning for automatic irrigation systems to enhance decision-making and
                    optimize water management beyond simple rule-based approaches. By analyzing large volumes of data
                    from soil moisture sensors, weather forecasts, and historical irrigation patterns, machine learning
                    algorithms can identify complex patterns and make more accurate predictions.</p>
                    <p>• Data analysis supports predictive capabilities, allowing.</p>

                <h2>Brain Tumor Boundary Detection For Prognostic Assessment</h2>
                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> CNN, Machine Learning</p>
                        <p>• CNNs are specialized deep learning models designed to automatically extract and analyze features from
                            images. In medical imaging, they are used to detect and classify abnormalities, such as brain tumors, by
                            recognizing patterns and structures within MRI scans.</p>
                        <p>• Machine learning algorithms analyze data to identify patterns and make predictions without being
                            explicitly programmed. In healthcare, ML is used to predict disease progression, personalize treatments,
                            and improve diagnostic accuracy by learning from large datasets. </p>

                    <h2>Motion Detection Automatic Switch using Python and IoT</h2>
                    <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong>  Python, IoT Modules, Computer Vision Module</p>
                            <p>• Computer Vision Module utilizes OpenCV and YOLOv3 for real-time person detection using a webcam.
                                Calculates power consumption based on the time a person is detected. Communicates with ThingSpeak
                                API to update the detection status and power consumption.</p>
                            <p>• IoT Modules connects to Wi-Fi using specified credentials. Reads data from ThingSpeak, including
                                person detection status and power consumption. Controls an LED based on the person detection status.
                                Collects and sends data to ThingSpeak for further analysis. </p>

            <h2>Image Transmission Using Under Water Wireless Optical Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Wireless Optical Communication</p>
                    <p>• Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) enables image transmission using light. LEDs or
                        lasers encode data; photodetectors capture signals. UWOC revolutionizes underwater data transfer,
                        promising speed and reliability.</p>
                    <p>• This novel approach promises unparalleled clarity and reliability in underwater environments, unlocking
                        new possibilities for exploration, surveillance, and scientific research in the depths of our oceans. It
                        includes developing compression methods suitable for optical channels, adapting modulation techniques
                        to underwater conditions, and simulating channel behavior. </p>
